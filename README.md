# ecommerce-web-scraping
This repository will show how to scrape an indonesian ecommerce using `selenium` for automation ,`bs4` for web parsing, and `pandas` for data manipulation.

The code will include some data cleaning process before storing the collected data. This cleaning process will make it easier for the analysis process when the data is needed.
